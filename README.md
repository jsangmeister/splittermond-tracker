# Splittermond Tracker

A helper tool to track your spent focus, life & splinter points and support the management of them.

## Execution

Simply download the correct file for your operating system from the [latest release](https://github.com/jsangmeister/splittermond-tracker/releases/latest) (`*.exe` for Windows [not the `*.exe.blockmap` file!] and `*.AppImage` for linux) and execute it.

### Linux

To execute the AppImage, you might have to make it executable first. Open a console in the folder of the AppImage and execute the following command:
```
chmox +x splittermond-tracker-<version>.AppImage
```
Replace `<version>` with your appropriate version number. Afterwards, you can execute it via:
```
./splittermond-tracker-<version>.AppImage
```

### A note on macOS

macOs is unfortunately not supported as Apple does not allow execution of unsigned programs. Acquiring the certificate to sign a program costs a yearly fee and the development requires a macOS device. Fuck Apple.
